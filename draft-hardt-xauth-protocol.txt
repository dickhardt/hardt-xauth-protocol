                           The XAuth Protocol
                     draft-hardt-xauth-protocol-00

Abstract

   Client software often desires resources or identity claims that are
   managed independent of the client.  This protocol allows a user and/
   or resource owner to delegate resource authorization and/or release
   of identity claims to an authorization server.  Client software can
   then request access to resources and/or identity claims by calling
   the authorization server.  The authorization server acquires consent
   and authorization from the user and/or resource owner if required,
   and then returns the authorization and identity claims that were
   approved.  This protocol can be extended to support alternative
   client authentication mechanisms, authorizations, claims, and
   interactions.

   [Editor: suggestions on how to improve this are welcome!]

   [Editor: suggestions for other names than XAuth are welcome!]

1.  Introduction

   This protocol supports the widely deployed use cases supported by
   OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] & [RFC6750], and OpenID Connect [OIDC], an
   extension of OAuth 2.0, as well as other extensions, and other use
   cases that are not supported, such as requesting multiple
   authorizations in one request.  This protocol also addresses many of
   the security issues in OAuth 2.0 by having parameters securely sent
   directly between parties, rather than via a browser redirection.

   The technology landscape has changed since OAuth 2.0 was initially
   drafted.  More interactions happen on mobile devices than PCs.
   Modern browsers now directly support asymetric cryptographic
   functions.  Standards have emerged for signing and encrypting tokens
   with rich payloads (JOSE) that are widely deployed.

   Additional use cases are now being served with extensions to OAuth
   2.0: OpenID Connect added support for authentication and releasing
   identity claims; [RFC8252] added support for native apps; [RFC8628]
   added support for smart devices; and support for [browser_based_apps]
   is being worked on.  There are numerous efforts on adding proof-of-
   possession to resource access.

   This protocol simplifies the overall architectural model, takes
   advantage of today's technology landscape, provides support for all
   the widely deployed use cases, and offers numerous extension points.

   While this protocol is not backwards compatible with OAuth 2.0, it
   strives to minimize the migration effort.

2.  Protocol

2.1.  Parties

   *  *Authorization Server* (AS) - manages Client authorization to API
      resources and release of identity claims about the User.  The AS
      may require explicit consent from the RO or User to provide these
      to the Client.

   *  *Client* - requests authorization to API resources, and/or
      identity claims about the User.  There are two types of Clients:
      Registered Clients and Dynamic Clients.  An AS may support only
      one or both types.  All Clients have a key to authenticate with
      the AS.

   *  *Registered Client* - a Client that has registered with the AS and
      has a Client ID to identify itself, and can prove it possesses a
      key that is linked to the Client ID.  The AS may have different
      policies for what different Registered Clients can request.  The
      Client MAY be interacting with a User.

   *  *Dynamic Client* - a Client that has not been registered with the
      AS, and each instance will generate it's own key pair so it can
      prove it is the same instance of the Client on subsequent
      requests.  A single-page application with no server is an example
      of a Dynamic Client.  The Client MUST be interacting with a User.

   *  *User* - the person who has delegated making identity claims about
      themselves to the AS, and is interacting with the Client.

   *  *Resource Server* (RS) - has API resources that require an access
      token from the AS for access.

   *  *Resource Owner* (RO) - owns the RS, and has delegated RS access
      token creation to the AS.  The RO may be the same entity as the
      User, or may be a different entity that the AS interacts with
      independent of the Client.

2.2.  Handles

   Handles are strings issued by the AS to the Client, that are opaque
   to the Client.

   *  *completion handle* - represents the client request.  Presented
      back to the AS in a completion request.

   *  *access handle* - represents the access the AS has granted the
      Client to the RS.  The Client proves possession of its key when
      presenting an access handle to access an RS.  The RS is able to
      understand the authorizations represented by the access handle
      directly, or through an introspection call.  The RS is able to
      verify the access handle was issued to the Client that presented
      it.

   *  *refresh handle* - represents the access the AS has granted the
      Client to a RS.  Presented back to the AS when the Client wants a
      fresh access token or access handle.

   When presenting any of the above handles, the Client always proves
   possession of its key.

2.3.  Reused Terms

   *  *access token* - an access token as defined in [RFC6749]
      Section 1.4.

   *  *Claims* - Claims as defined in [OIDC] Section 5.

   *  *Client ID* - an AS unique identifier for a Registered Client as
      defined in [RFC6749] Section 2.2.

   *  *ID Token* - an ID Token as defined in [OIDC] Section 2.

   *  *Claims* - Claims as defined in [OIDC] Section 5.

   *  *NumericDate* - a NumericDate as defined in [RFC7519] Section 2.

2.4.  Sequence

   1.  *AS Discovery* The Client discovers the AS end point, keys,
       supported claims and authorizations, and other capabilities.
       Some, or all of this information could be manually preconfigured,
       or dynamically obtained.  Dynamic AS discovery is out of scope of
       this document.

   2.  *Initiation Request* (Section 8.7) The Client creates an
       initiation request (Section 3) for authorization to API resources
       and/or identity claims about the User and sends it with an HTTP
       POST to the AS endpoint.

   3.  *Initiation Response* (Section 8.8) The AS processes the request
       and determines if it needs to interact with the RO or User.  If
       interaction is not required, the AS returns a completion response
       (Section 6).  If interaction is required the AS returns an
       initiation response (Section 4) that includes completion handle
       and uri, and interaction instructions if the AS wants the Client
       to start the interaction.

   4.  *Interaction* (Section 5) If the AS sent interaction instructions
       to the Client, the Client executes them.  The AS then interacts
       with the User and/or RO to obtain authorization.  The AS
       interaction with an RO may be asynchronous, and take time to
       complete.

   5.  *Completion Request* (Section 8.10) The Client sends the
       completion handle to the completion uri.  The Client may make the
       completion request while waiting for the interaction to complete.

   6.  *Completion Response* (Section 8.11) When any required
       interaction has been completed, the AS responds to the Client
       with a completion response (Section 6) containing authorized RS
       access tokens and User identity claims.  The AS may provide
       refresh handles and uris for each access token if they are
       authorized.  If proof-of-possession is required for accessing the
       RS, the AS will provide access handles instead of access tokens.
       If the AS has not completed the interaction, it will return a
       retry response for the Client to make a new completion request.

   7.  *Resource Request* (Section 8.12 & Section 8.13) The Client uses
       an access token with the RS, or the access handle if proof-of-
       possession is required for access.

   8.  *Access Refresh* (Section 8.14) If the Client received a refresh
       handle and uri, it sends the refresh handle to the refresh uri,
       and receives a fresh access token or handle.

3.  Initiation Request JSON

   Following is a non-normative JSON [RFC8259] document example where
   the Client wants to interact with the User with a popup and is
   requesting identity claims about the User and read access to the
   User's contacts:

   Example 1

   {
       "as"    :"https://as.example",
       "iat"   :"1579046092",
       "nonce" :"f6a60810-3d07-41ac-81e7-b958c0dd21e4",
       "client": {
           "display": {
               "name"  :"SPA Display Name",
               "uri"   :"https://spa.example/about"
           },
           "interaction": {
               "type"  :"popup"
           }
       },
       "authorizations": {
           "type"      :"oauth_scope",
           "scope"     :"read_contacts"
       },
       "claims": {
           "oidc": {
               "id_token" : {
                   "email"          : { "essential" : true },
                   "email_verified" : { "essential" : true }
               },
               "userinfo" : {
                   "name"           : { "essential" : true },
                   "picture"        : null
               }
           }
       }
   }

   Following is a non-normative example where the Client has previously
   authenticated the User, and is requesting additional authorization:

   Example 2

   {
      "as"     :"https://as.example",
       "iat"   :"1579046092",
       "nonce" :"0d1998d8-fbfa-4879-b942-85a88bff1f3b",
       "client": {
           "id"        : "di3872h34dkJW",
           "interaction": {
               "type"  : "redirect",
               "uri"   : "https://web.example/return"
           }
       },
       "user": {
           "identifiers": {
               "oidc": {
                   "iss"   :"https://as.example",
                   "sub"   :"123456789"
               }
           }
       },
       "authorizations": {
           "type"  :"oauth_scope",
           "scope" :"read_calendar write_calendar"
       }
   }

3.1.  Top Level Attributes

   *as* - the unique string identifier for the AS.  This attribute is
   REQUIRED.

   *iat* - the time of the request as a NumericDate.

   *nonce* - a unique identifier for this request.  This attribute is
   REQUIRED.  Note the completion response MUST contain a matching nonce
   attribute.

3.2.  "client" Object

   The client object MUST contain either the client_id attribute for
   Registered Clients, or the display object for Dynamic Clients.  If
   the Client can interact with the User, then an interaction object
   MUST be included.

   *client_id* - the identifier the AS has for the Registered Client.

   *display* - the display object contains the following attributes:

   *  *name* - a string that represents the Dynamic Client

   [Editor: a max length for the name?]

   *  *uri* - a URI representing the Dynamic Client

   [Editor: a max length for the name?]

   The name and uri will be displayed by the AS when prompting for
   authorization.

   *interaction* - the interaction object contains the type of
   interaction the Client will provide the User.  Other attributes are
   dependent on the interaction type value.

   *  *type* - contains one of the following values.  Types are listed
      from highest to lowest fidelity.  The interaction URI is the value
      returned by the AS in the initiation response interaction object
      Section 4.2, if a User interaction is required by the AS.

      -  *popup* - the Client will load the interaction URI in a modal
         popup window.  The AS will close the window when the
         interaction is complete.

      -  *redirect* - the Client will redirect the user agent to the
         interaction URI provided by the AS.  The AS will redirect to
         the redirect_uri when the interaction is completed.

      -  *qrcode* - the Client will convert the interaction URI to a QR
         Code per [QR_Code] and display it to the User, along with a
         text message.  The User will scan the QR Code and/or follow the
         message instructions.

   *  *redirect_uri* - this attribute is included if the type is
      "redirect".  It is the URI that the Client requests the AS to
      redirect the User to after the AS has completed interacting with
      the User.  If the Client manages session state in URIs, then the
      redirect_uri should contain that state.

   *  *ui_locales* - End-User's preferred languages and scripts for the
      user interface, represented as a space-separated list of [RFC5646]
      language tag values, ordered by preference.

   [Editor: do we need max pixels or max chars for qrcode interaction?
   Either passed to AS, or max specified values here?]

   [Editor: other possible interaction models could be a "webview",
   where the Client can display a web page, or just a "message", where
   the client can only display a text message]

   [Editor: we may need to include interaction types for iOS and Android
   as the mobile OS APIs evolve.]

   [Editor: does the Client include parameters if it wants the
   completion response signed and/or encrypted?]

3.3.  "user" Object

   The user object is optional.

   *identifiers* - the identifiers object contains one or more of the
   following identifiers for the User:

   *  *phone_number* - contains a phone number per Section 5 of
      [RFC3966].

   *  *email* - contains an email address per [RFC5322].

   *  *oidc* - is an object containing both the "iss" and "sub"
      attributes from an OpenID Connect ID Token per [OIDC] Section 2.

   The user and identifiers objects MAY be included to improve the user
   experience by the AS.  The AS MUST authenticate the User independent
   of these values.

   *discovery* - MUST contain the JSON true value.  Indicates the Client
   requests the AS to return a "discovered" attribute in the initiation
   response if the AS has a User at the AS with one or more of the
   identifiers.  This attribute is OPTIONAL.  Supporting by the AS of
   the discovery attribute is OPTIONAL.  The AS MAY return the TBD error
   if discovery is not supported, or ignore the request.

3.4.  "authorizations" Object

   The optional authorizations object contains a dictionary of resource
   objects the Client is requesting authorization to access.  The
   authorizations object may contain one or more of:

   *  *type* - one of the following values: "oauth_scope", "oauth_rich",
      or "oauth_rich_list".  See Section 3.6 for details.

   *  *scope* - a string containing the OAuth 2.0 scope per [RFC6749]
      section 3.3.  Present if type is "oauth_scope" or "oauth_rich".

   *  *authorization_details* - an authorization_details object per
      [RAR].  Present if type is "oauth_rich".

   *  *list* - an array of objects containing "scope" and
      "authorization_details".  Present if type is "oauth_rich_list".
      Used when requesting multiple access tokens and/or handles.

   [Editor: details may change as the [RAR] document evolves]

3.5.  "claims" Object

   The optional claims object contains one or more identity claims being
   requested.  The claims may contain:

   *  *oidc* - an object that contains one or both of the following
      objects:

      -  *userinfo* - Claims that will be returned as a JSON object

      -  *id_token* - Claims that will be included in the returned ID
         Token.  If the null value, an ID Token will be returned
         containing no additional Claims.

   The contents of the userinfo and id_token objects are Claims as
   defined in [OIDC] Section 5.

   *  vc - [Editor: define how W3C Verifiable Credentials [W3C_VC] can
      be requested.]

3.6.  Authorization Types

   *  *oauth_scope* - an OAuth 2.0 authorization request per [RFC6749]
      section 3.3

   *  *oauth_rich* - a rich authorization request per [RAR]

   *  *oauth_rich_list* - a list of rich authorization requests

4.  Initiation Response JSON

   A non-normative example of an initiation response follows:

   {
       "user": {
           "discovered": true
       },
       "interaction": {
           "type"   : "popup",
           "uri"    : "https://as.example/endpoint/ey5gs32..."
       },
       "completion": {
           "handle" : "eyJhb958.example.completion.handle.9yf3szM",
           "uri"    : "https://as.example/completion/ey7snHGs",
           "wait"   : "10"
       }
   }

4.1.  "user" Object

   If the initiation request included a discovery attribute, then the AS
   MAY return a "user" object with the "discovered" property set to the
   JSON value true if one or more of the identifiers provided in the
   initiation request identify a User at the AS, or the JSON value false
   if not.

   [Editor: reference a security consideration for this functionality.]

4.2.  "interaction" Object

   If the AS wants the Client to start the interaction, the AS MUST
   select one of the interaction mechanisms provided by the Client in
   the initiation request, and include the matching attribute in the
   interaction object:

   *  *type* - this MUST match the type provided by the Client in the
      initiation request client.interaction object.

   *  *uri* - the URI to interact with the User per the type.  This may
      be a temporary short URL if the type is qrcode so that it is easy
      to scan.

   *  *message* - a text string to display to the User if type is
      qrcode.

   [Editor: do we specify a maximum length for the uri and message so
   that a device knows the maximum it needs to support?  A smart device
   may have limited screen real estate.]

4.3.  "completion" Object

   The completion object has the following attributes:

   *  *handle* - the completion handle.  This attribute is REQUIRED.

   *  *uri* - the completion URI.  This attribute is REQUIRED.

   *  *wait* - the amount of time in integer seconds the Client MUST
      wait before making the completion request.  This attribute is
      OPTIONAL.

5.  Interaction Types

   If the AS wants the Client to initiate the interaction with the User,
   then the AS will return an interaction object Section 4.2 so that the
   Client can can hand off interactions with the User to the AS.  The
   Client will initiate the interaction with the User in one of the
   following ways:

5.1.  "popup" Type

   The Client will create a new popup child browser window containing
   the value of the uri attribute of the interaction object.  [Editor:
   more details on how to do this]

   The AS will close the window when the interactions with the User are
   complete.  [Editor: confirm AS can do this still on all browsers, or
   does Client need to close]

   The AS MAY respond to an outstanding completion request Section 8.10
   before the popup window has been closed.

5.2.  "redirect" Type

   The Client will redirect the User to the value of the uri attribute
   of the interaction object.  When the AS interactions with the User
   are complete, the AS will redirect the User to the redirect_uri the
   Client provided in the initiation request.

   If the Client made a completion request when starting the
   interaction, the AS MAY respond to the completion request
   Section 8.10 before the User has been redirected back to the Client.

5.3.  "qrcode" Type

   The Client will create a [QR_Code] of the uri attribute of the
   interaction object and display the resulting graphic and the message
   attribute of the interaction object as a text string.

6.  Completion Response JSON

   Example non-normative completion response JSON document for Example 1

           }
       }
   }

   Details of the JSON document:

6.1.  Top Level Attributes

   *iat* - the time of the response as a NumericDate.

   *nonce* - the nonce that was included in the initiation request JSON
   Section 3.

6.2.  "authorizations" Object

   There is an authorizations object in the completion response if there
   was an authorizations object in the initiation request.

   *  *type* - the type of claim request: "oauth_scope", "oauth_rich",
      or "oauth_rich_list".  See Section 3.6 for details.

   *  *list* - an array of objects if the type was "oauth_rich_list".
      The objects have the following attributes just as if the type was
      "oauth_rich"

   *  *scope* - the scopes the Client was granted authorization for.
      This will be all, or a subset, of what was requested.

   *  *authorization_details* - the authorization details granted.  Only
      returned for "oauth_rich" and "oauth_rich_list".

   *  *method* - the access method: "bearer" or "pop".  See Section 6.4
      for details.

   *  *token* - an access token for accessing the resource(s).  Included
      if the access method is "bearer".

   *  *expires_in* - an optional value specifying how many seconds until
      the access token or handle expire.

   *  *refresh* - an optional object containing parameters required to
      refresh an access token or handle.  See refresh request
      Section 8.14.

      -  *handle* - an refresh handle used to create the JSON refresh
         token.

      -  *uri* - the refresh uri the Client will use to refresh.

   *  *access* - an object containing the parameters needed to access
      resources requiring proof-of-possession.  Included if the access
      method is "pop".

      -  *handle* - the access handle.

      -  *jwk* - the jwk object to use.

6.3.  "claims" Object

   There is a claims object in the completion response if there was a
   claims object in the initiation request.

   *  *oidc*

      -  *id_token* - an OpenID Connect ID Token containing the Claims
         the User consented to be released.

      -  *userinfo* - the Claims the User consented to be released.

      Claims are defined in [OIDC] Section 5.

   *  *vc*

      The verified claims the user consented to be released.  [Editor:
      details TBD]

6.4.  Access Types

   There are two types of access to an RS:

   *  *bearer* - the AS provides a bearer access token that the Client
      can use to access an RS per Section 8.12.

   *  *pop* - the AS provides an access handle that the Client presents
      in a proof-of-possession RS access request per Section 8.13.

7.  Discovery

   The Client obtains the following metadata about the AS prior to
   initiating a request:

   *Endpoint* - the endpoint of the AS.

   *"as"* - the unique string identifier for the AS.

   *Algorithms* - the asymetric cryptographic algorithms supported by
   the AS.

   *Authorizations* - the authorizations the Client may request, if any.

   *Identity Claims* - the identity claims the Client may request, if
   any, and what public keys the claims will be signed with.

   The client may also obtain information about how the AS will sign
   and/or encrypt the completion response, as well as any other metadata
   required for extensions to this protocol, as defined in those
   extension specifications.

8.  JOSE Client Authentication

   The default mechanism for the Client to authenticate to the AS and
   the RS is signing a JSON document with JWS per [RFC7515].  The
   resulting tokens always use compact serialization.

   It is expected that extensions to this protocol that specify a
   different mechanism for the Client to authenticate, would over ride
   this section.

   The completion request JSON is signed with JWS and passed as the body
   of the POST.

   The completion, refresh, and access handles are signed with JWS
   resulting in JOSE completion, refresh, and access tokens
   respectively.  These JOSE tokens are passed in the HTTP Authorization
   header with the "JOSE" parameter per Section 8.5.

   The Client will use the same private key to create all tokens.

   The Client and the AS MUST both use HTTP/2 ([RFC7540]) or later, and
   TLS 1.3 ([RFC8446]) or later, when communicating with each other.

   [Editor: too aggressive to mandate HTTP/2 and TLS 1.3?]

8.1.  JOSE Headers

   A non-normative example of a JOSE header for a Registered Client
   using a key id to identify the Client's public key:

   {
       "alg":"ES256",
       "typ":"JOSE",
       "kid":"1"
   }

   A non-normative example of a JOSE header for a Registered Client
   using a certificate to assert the Client's public key:

   {
       "alg":"ES256",
       "typ":"JOSE",
       "jwk":
           {"kty":"RSA",

   [Editor: the jwk above was copy and pasted from the JWK example.
   Replace? ]

   The certificate could be signed by the AS, allowing the AS to verify
   the signature using the AS public key, or the certificate could be
   signed by a private key the AS has bound to the Registered Client,
   allowing each instance of the Registered Client to have its own
   asymetric key pair.

   A non-normative example of a JOSE header for a Dynamic Client
   including the public key generated by the Client that matches its its
   private key:

   {
       "alg":"ES256",
       "typ":"JOSE",
       "jwk":{
           "kty":"EC",
           "crv":"P-256",
           "x":"Kgl5DJSgLyV-G32osmLhFKxJ97FoMW0dZVEqDG-Cwo4",
           "y":"GsL4mOM4x2e6iON8BHvRDQ6AgXAPnw0m0SfdlREV7i4"
       }
   }

   A non-normative example of a JOSE Access Token JOSE header for a
   Client accessing an RS that requires proof-of-possession:

   {
       "alg":"ES256",
       "typ":"JOSE",
       "jwk":{
           "x5u":"https://as.example/jwk/VBUEOIQA82"
       }
   }

   The "jwk" object in a JOSE access token Section 8.4 MUST be the AS
   jwk object the AS provided with the access handle.

   This decouples how the AS communicates the Client's public key to the
   RS from how the AS asserts the Client's public key.  The RS can have
   a consistent mechanism assert the Client's public key across all
   Clients.

   One advantage of this is the AS can create a certificate of a Dynamic
   Client's public key, and pass it by value or reference to the Client
   to present to the RS.

   All JOSE headers MUST have: + the "alg" attribute. + the "typ"
   attribute set to "jose". + either a "kid" or "jwk" attribute.

   [Editor: should we use indicate the type of token (completion,
   refresh, access) using "typ" or "cty"?]

8.2.  JOSE Completion Token

   A non-normative example of a payload follows:

   {
       "as"    :"https://as.example",
       "type"  :"completion",
       "iat"   :"1579046092",
       "jti"   :"f6d72254-4f23-417f-b55e-14ad323b1dc1",
       "handle":"eyJhb958.example.completion.handle.9yf3szM"
   }

   The payload of the completion token contains:

   *as* - the unique string identifier for the AS.

   *type* - the string "completion", indicating the type of token.

   *iat* - the time the completion token was created as a NumericDate.

   *jti* - a unique identifier for the completion token per [RFC7519]
   section 4.1.7.

   *handle* the completion handle the AS provided the Client in the
   initiation response Section 4.

8.3.  JOSE Refresh Token

   A non-normative example of a payload follows:

   {
       "as"    :"https://as.example",
       "type"  :"refresh",
       "iat"   :"1579049876",
       "jti"   :"4342046d-83c4-4725-8c72-e9a49245f791",
       "handle":"eyJhb958.example.refresh.handle.9yf3szM"

   *type* - the string "refresh", indicating the type of token.

   *iat* - the time the JOSE refresh token was created as a NumericDate.

   *jti* - a unique identifier for the JOSE refresh token.

   *handle* the refresh handle the AS provided the Client in the
   completion response Section 6 or access refresh response
   Section 8.14.

8.4.  JOSE Access Token

   The "jwk" object in a JOSE access token header MUST be set to the
   "jwk" value the AS provided for the access handle.

   A non-normative example of a payload follows:

   {
       "type"  :"access",
       "iat"   :"1579046092",
       "jti"   :"5ef47057-08f9-4763-be8d-162824d43dfb",
       "handle":"eyJhb958.example.access.handle.9yf3szM"
   }

   The payload of the JOSE access token contains:

   *type* - the string "access", indicating the type of token.

   *iat* - the time the JOSE access token was created as a NumericDate.

   *jti* - a unique identifier for the JOSE access token.

   *handle* the access handle the AS provided the Client in the
   completion response Section 6 or access refresh response
   Section 8.14.

8.5.  HTTP Authorization JOSE Header

   The Client authenticates requests by setting the HTTP Authorization
   header to include the "JOSE" parameter, followed by one or more space
   characters, followed by the appropriate JOSE token.

   A non-normative example:

   Authorization: JOSE eyJhb.example.completion.token.haDwskpFDBW

   The JOSE completion token, JOSE refresh token, and the JOSE access
   token are all passed in this manner.

8.6.  JOSE Token Verification

   TBD

8.7.  Initiation Request

   The Client creates a JSON document per Section 3, signs it using JWS
   [RFC7515], and sends the JWS token to the AS end point using HTTP
   POST, with a content-type of application/jose.

   *  *Payload Encryption*

   The AS may require the initiation request to be encrypted.  If so,
   the JWS token is encrypted per JWE [RFC7516] using the public key and
   algorithm specified by the AS.

8.8.  Initiation Response

   If no interaction is required the AS will return a completion
   response per Section 8.11, otherwise the AS will return an initiation
   response per Section 4.

   If the AS wants the Client to start the interaction, an interaction
   object will be returned in the response.

   *  *Error Responses*

   The AS MAY respond with one of the following errors defined in
   Section 9:

   TBD

8.9.  Deletion Request

   The Client MAY delete an outstanding request using the completion
   token by making an HTTP DELETE call to the completion uri, setting
   the HTTP Authorization header per Section 8.5 with the JOSE
   completion token.

   A non-normative deletion request example:

   DELETE /completion/ey7snHGs HTTP/2
   Host: as.example
   Authorization: JOSE eyJhb.example.completion.token.haDwskpFDBW

   *  *Error Responses*

   The AS MAY respond with one of the following errors defined in
   Section 9:

   TBD

8.10.  Completion Request

   The Client makes an HTTP GET call to the completion uri, setting the
   HTTP Authorization header per Section 8.5 with the JOSE completion
   token.

   A non-normative completion request example:

   GET /completion/ey7snHGs HTTP/2
   Host: as.example
   Authorization: JOSE eyJhb.example.completion.token.haDwskpFDBW

8.11.  Completion Response

   The AS verifies the JOSE completion token, and then provides a
   response according to what the User and/or RO have authorized if
   required.  If no signature or encryption was required, the AS will
   respond with a JSON document with content-type set to application/
   json.

   *  *Response Signing*

   The AS MAY sign the response with a JWS per [RFC7515] and the private
   key matching the public key the AS defined as its completion response
   signing key.  The AS will respond with the content-type set to
   application/jose.

   *  *Response Encryption*

   The AS MAY encrypt the response using the public key provided by the
   Client, using JWE per [RFC7516].  The AS will respond with the
   content-type set to application/jose.

   *  *Error Responses*

   The AS MAY respond with one of the following errors defined in
   Section 9:

   TBD

8.12.  Bearer Token RS Access

   If the access method in the completion response authorizations object
   Section 6.2 was "bearer", then the Client accesses the RS per
   Section 2.1 of [RFC6750]

   A non-normative example of the HTTP request headers follows:

   GET /calendar HTTP/2
   Host: calendar.example
   Authorization: bearer eyJJ2D6.example.access.token.mZf9pTSpA

   *  *Error Responses*

   TBD

8.13.  Proof-of-possession RS Access

   If the access method in the completion response authorizations object
   Section 6.2 was "pop", then the Client creates a JOSE access token
   per Section 8.4 for each call to the RS, setting the HTTP
   Authorization header per Section 8.5 with the JOSE access token.

   A non-normative example of the HTTP request headers follows:

   GET /calendar HTTP/2
   Host: calendar.example
   Authorization: JOSE eyJhbG.example.JOSE.access.token.kwwQb958

   *  *Error Responses*

   TBD

8.14.  Access Refresh

   If the Client received a refresh handle and uri from the AS in the
   initiation response, and it wants a fresh access token or handle, it
   creates a JOSE refresh token per Section 8.3.  setting the HTTP
   Authorization header per Section 8.5 with the JOSE refresh token.
   The AS will then respond with a refresh response.

   *  *Refresh Response*

   A non-normative example refresh response with an access handle:

   {
       "type"          : "oauth_scope",
       "scope"         : "read_calendar write_calendar",
       "expires_in"    : "3600",
       "method"        : "pop",
       "access": {
           "handle"    : "ey.example.access.handle.9yf3iWszM",
           "jwk": {
               "x5u"   : "https://as.example/jwk/VBUEOIQA82"
           }
       },
       "refresh": {
           "handle"    : "ey.example.refresh.handle.4SkjIi",
           "uri"       : "https://as.example/refresh/eyJl4FzM"
       }
   }

   The refresh response is the same as the authorizations object
   Section 6.2 in the completion response.

   If a new refresh handle and/or refresh uri is returned, the Client
   MUST use the new refresh handle and/or refresh uri

   [Editor: are there other results relevant for [RAR]?]

   *  *Error Responses*

   The AS MAY respond with one of the following errors defined in
   Section 9:

   TBD

9.  Error Messages

   \[Editor: return "wait" time in completion response when AS wants Client to wait before retying a completion request.
   The Client MUST generate a fresh completion token when retrying the completion request.
   ]

   TBD

10.  AS Initiated Sequence

   [Editor: AS initiated flows have been challenging to implement as
   OAuth 2.0 did not directly support them, so deployments bounced back
   and forth between the Client and AS to create a Client initiated
   flow.  Here is a proposal to support AS initiated: authentication;
   just-in-time (JIT) provisioning; and authorization]

   In this sequence the User starts at the AS, and then based on User
   input, the AS redirects the User to a Client, passing an initiation
   token Section 10.1, and then the Client retrieves authorizations and/
   or identity claims about the User.  The Client MUST be a Registered
   Client.  The sequence follows:

   1.  The User is interacting at the AS and wants to use the Client,
       and provide the Client identity claims and/or authorizations from
       the AS that the Client has pre-configured.

   2.  The AS creates a completion handle and uri representing the
       identity claims and authorizations to be provided to the Client.
       The AS creates an initiation token containing the AS identifier,
       the completion handle, and the completion uri.

   3.  The AS redirects the User to a URI the Client has configured to
       accept initiation tokens, passing the initiation token as a query
       parameters with the name "token".

   4.  The Client verifies the initiation token.

   5.  The Client makes a completion request per Section 8.10.

   6.  The AS responds with a completion response JSON document
       Section 6 per Section 8.11.

   The Client now has the User identity claims and/or authorizations.
   If Client policy permits, the Client can perform JIT provisioning if
   the User is new to the Client.

10.1.  Initiation Token

   A non-normative example of an initiation token payload follows:

   {
       "as": "https://as.example",
       "completion": {
           "handle" : "eyJhb958.example.completion.handle.9yf3szM",
           "uri"    : "https://as.example/completion/ey7snHGs"
       }
   }

   *  *as* - the "as" identifier for the AS.  This attribute is
      REQUIRED.

   *  *completion* - the completion object has the following attributes:

      -  *handle* - the completion handle.  This attribute is REQUIRED.

      -  *uri* - the completion URI.  This attribute is REQUIRED.

   The initiation token is signed with JWS and uses the compact
   serialization.

11.  Extensibility

   This standard can be extended in a number of areas:

   *  *Client Authentication Mechanisms*

   An extension could define other mechanisms for the Client to
   authenticate and replace JOSE in Section 8 with Mutual TLS or HTTP
   Signing.  Constrained environments could use CBOR [RFC7049] instead
   of JSON, and COSE [RFC8152] instead of JOSE, and CoAP [RFC8323]
   instead of HTTP/2.

   *  *Initiation Request*

   An additional top level object could be added to the initiation
   request payload if the AS can manage delegations other than
   authorizations or claims, or some other functionality.

   *  *"client" Object*

   Additional information about the Client that the AS would require
   related to an extension.

   *  *"user" Object*

   Additional information about the Client that the AS would require
   related to an extension.

   *  *"authorizations" Object*

   Additional types of authorizations in addition to OAuth 2.0 scopes
   and RAR.

   *  *"claims" Object*

   Additional types of identity claims in addition to OpenID Connect
   claims and Verified Credentials.

   *  *Interaction*

   Additional mechanisms for the Client to start an interaction with the
   User.

   *  *Access Methods*

   Additional mechanisms for the Client to present authorization to a
   resource.

   document, or leave that to an extension?]

   [Editor: do we specify access token / handle revocation in this
   document, or leave that to an extension?]

12.  Rational

   1.   *Why is there only one mechanism for the Client to authenticate
        with the AS?  Why not support other mechanisms?*

        Having choices requires implementers to understand which choice
        is preferable for them.  Having one default mechanism in the
        document for the Client to authenticate simplifies most
        implementations.  Extensions can specify other mechanisms that
        are preferable in specific environments.

   2.   *Why is the default Client authentication JOSE rather than
        MTLS?*

        MTLS cannot be used today by a Dynamic Client.  MTLS requires
        the application to have access below what is typically the
        application layer, that is often not available on some
        platforms.  JOSE is done at the application layer.  Many AS
        deployments will be an application behind a proxy performing
        TLS, and there are risks in the proxy passing on the results of
        MTLS.

   3.   *Why is the default Client authentication JOSE rather than HTTP
        signing?*

        There is currently no widely deployed open standard for HTTP
        signing.  Additionally, HTTP signing requires passing all the
        relevant parts of the HTTP request to downstream services within
        an AS that may need to independently verify the Client identity.

   4.   *What are the advantages of using JOSE for the Client to
        authenticate to the AS and a resource?*

        Both Registered Clients and Dynamic Clients can have a private
        key, eliminating the public Client issues in OAuth 2.0, as a
        Dynamic Client can create an ephemeral key pair.  Using
        asymetric cryptography also allows each instance of a Registered
        Client to have its own private key if it can obtain a
        certificate binding its public key to the public key the AS has
        for the Client.  Signed tokens can be passed to downstream
        components in a AS or RS to enable independent verification of
        the Client and its request.  The AS Initiated Sequence
        Section 10 requires a URL safe parameter, and JOSE is URL safe.

   5.   *Why does the AS not return parameters to the Client in the
        redirect url?*

        Passing parameters via a browser redirection is the source of
        many of the security risks in OAuth 2.0.  It also presents a
        challenge for smart devices.  In this protocol, the redirection
        from the Client to the AS is to enable the AS to interact with
        the User, and the redirection back to the Client is to hand back
        interaction control to the Client if the redirection was a full
        browser redirect.  Unlike OAuth 2.0, the identity of the Client
        is independent of the URI the AS redirects to.

   6.   *Why is there not a UserInfo endpoint as there is with OpenID
        Connect?*

        In OpenID Connect, obtaining claims over the redirect or the
        Token Endpoint are problematic.  The redirect is limited in
        size, and is not secure.  The Token Endpoint is intended to
        return tokens, and is limited by the "application/x-www-form-
        urlencoded" format.  A UserInfo endpoint returns "application/
        json", and can return rich claims, just as the completion uri in
        this protocol.

        [Editor: is there some other reason to have the UserInfo
        endpoint?  What are industry best practices now? ]

   7.   *Why is there still a Client ID?  Could we not use a fingerprint
        of the public key to identify the Client?*

        Some AS deployments do not allow calls from Registered Clients,
        and provide different functionality to different Clients.  A
        permanent identifier for the Client is needed for the Client
        developer and the AS admin to ensure they are referring to the
        same Client.  The Client ID was used in OAuth 2.0, and it served
        the same purpose.

   8.   *Why have both claims and authorizations?*

        There are use cases for each that are independent:
        authenticating a user vs granting access to a resource.  A
        request for an authorization returns an access token or handle,
        while a request for a claim returns the claim.

   9.   *Why specify HTTP/2 or later and TLS 1.3 or later for Client and
        AS communication in ?*Section 8

        Knowing the AS supports HTTP/2 enables a Client to set up a
        connection faster.  HTTP/2 will be more efficient when Clients
        have large numbers of access tokens and are frequently
        refreshing them at the AS as there will be less network traffic.
        Mandating TLS 1.3 similarly improves the performance and
        security of Clients and AS when setting up a TLS connection.

   10.  *Why do some of the JSON objects only have one child, such as
        the identifiers object in the user object in the initiation
        request?*

        It is difficult to forecast future use cases.  Having more
        resolution may mean the difference between a simple extension,
        and a convoluted extension.

   11.  *Why is the "iss" included in the "oidc" identifier object?
        Would the "sub" not be enough for the AS to identify the User?*

        The AS may use another AS to authenticate Users.  The "iss" and
        "sub" combination is required to uniquely identify the User for
        any AS.

Appendix A.  Document History

A.1.  draft-hardt-xauth-protocol-00

   *  Initial version

Appendix B.  Comparison with OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect

   *Changed Features*

   The major differences between this protocol and OAuth 2.0 and OpenID
   Connect are:

   *  The Client uses a private key to authenticate in this protocol
      instead of the client secret in OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect.

   *  The Client initiates the protocol by making a signed request
      directly to the AS instead of redirecting the User to the AS.

   *  The Client does not receive any parameters from a redirection of
      the User back from the AS.

   *  Refreshing an access token requires creating a refresh token from
      a refresh handle, rather than an authenticated call with a refresh
      token.

   *  The Client can request identity claims to be returned independent
      of the ID Token.  There is no UserInfo endpoint to query claims as
      there is in OpenID Connect.

   *Preserved Features*

   *  This protocol reuses the OAuth 2.0 scopes, Client IDs, and access
      tokens of OAuth 2.0.

   *  This protocol reuses the Client IDs, Claims and ID Token of OpenID
      Connect.

   *  No change is required by the Client or the RS for existing APIs.
